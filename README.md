## **Why does it feel like everywhere is far away in Beijing?**
## 为什么在北京感觉去哪里都很远？

### **Abstract:** 

Based on my experiences living in both Beijing and Shanghai, as well as complaints from friends, it is generally perceived that living in Beijing feels more inconvenient, particularly in terms of feeling that every destination is far away. This article, using open data from OpenStreetMap and spatial analysis methods, verifies this experience through data analysis. Compared to Shanghai, Beijing displays several distinct characteristics: 

1) a lower overall density of commercial resources; 

2) fewer commercially accessible resources within walking distance of public transportation stops; 

3) a lower density of road networks; 

4) due to unique historical reasons, Beijing's distinctive urban layout increases the likelihood of taking longer routes while driving.
